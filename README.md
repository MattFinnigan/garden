Garden Journal & Planner App made for myself. Vue/Laravel

Original pitch was a planner that tracks how much space is available in a garden space in a given month of the season/year. Plant space requirements would be entered, crops filled the space of a garden in the UI. This would effectively visualize a garden space in the selected month, allowing for planning & sowing of crops in future much easier. You could also select a crop and add 'reports/journal entries', attaching photos, dates, state (harvest ready, whithering, etc) for record keeping.

Need to find time to finish this!
